Win Win.\u00a0 Your aggressively negative response is probably the best evidence that the proposal would be effective and that prior proposals would not that anyone could possibly have wanted. \u00a0--- not that anyone specifically has the goal of pissing you off, but you've been insistent on creating and driving usage that is at odds with the creators intention for testnet and changes that make it less useful for your purposes make it more useful for the authors purposes. \u00a0Bitcoin developers have hosted a lawn party, you built a sand castle on the bank of their wave pool, under a \"no sand castles here\" sign-- it literally says \"test\" in the name--, you don't get to throw a fit when they turn the waves on. \u00a0As far as your question, I'm not aware of any bitcoin core contributor that has any financial interest in citrea and I asked around a bit-- but also it's kind of a dumb question because this change should be of no meaningful financial benefit to citrea: They're already stuffing their data in fake outputs. Assuming there is ever a meaningful amount of that particular traffic (which itself is a big assumption) the benefit would be to all future users of bitcoin in reducing the amount of unprunable utxo bloat. \u00a0It's also a dumb question in that the whole premise of Bitcoin is that people adopt it for their own interests, the gauge under which it should be judged is does it help or harm others. \u00a0Lets imagine it were amazingly helpful for them (though I don't see how), so what? \u00a0If anything that would be a point in its favor. \u00a0It would be another issue if it were the only reason to do it, but as I mentioned up thread I commented in support of this proposal without any idea what citrea was, I don't consider it particularly relevant except as a concrete example of one thing that currently uses fake outputs that would probably switch.",

        "body": "That was in a climate where miners were not allowing direct submission to bypass these restrictions. \u00a0In my view that fact is what shifts the limit from being no longer necessary but of no significant harm to somewhat harmful.Subject matter expert understanding was broadly always that this sort of limit was an unstable equilibrium that wouldn't be sustained as mining transitioned from being subsidy driven towards being fee driven.In 2014 public bitcoin understanding was often far less sophisticated than today, people often wanted to stuff data in where they would be better off according to their _own goals_ if they included a hash (or using OTS, if it had existed) or doing something else entirely. \u00a0And there was far less understanding about the downsides and potential harms of (ab)using the Bitcoin system as 'data storage'. \u00a0Back then when I was defending the limitation on online people were so mad about it they were making threats of violence against me and in many discussions I stood alone in defending limiting it. \u00a0The world is very different now. \u00a0There are also plenty of less expensive alternatives for many things people wanted to stuff data in for, ifps, nostr, other blockchains. \u00a0What remains today are things where people do rationally judge that they benefit from putting the data in bitcoin, so much so that they are willing to do so at significant expense and that is much harder to dissuade.And the concept of generally appointing people to judge how others are using Bitcoin is repulsive to the premise that Satoshi set out for the system-- Bitcoin shouldn't have and doesn't need \"experts\" passing judgement on other people's ability to transact. \u00a0Fortunately, Satoshi designed a system where the ability to do so is fairly limited and fragile: for better or worse. \u00a0 There isn't such thing as a freedom that doesn't have its negatives. \u00a0And the fact that the ability to filter stuff that is willing to pay is limited in Bitcoin is among them. \u00a0Moreover, data embedding can hide as indistinguishable from other uses -- in particular by shoving their data as fake addresses in outputs, which is hardly any worse for the embedder, but much worse for Bitcoin and just not blockable through any amount of expert judgement short of stuff like only allowing Bitcoin to be sent to approved, whitelisted, kyced, addresses!  So sure, we can say that stuffing in outside data isn't a restriction on people's freedom to actually transact, but as far as we know there is no way to eliminate the ability to (ab)use bitcoin for outside data that is willing to pay which isn't equally (in)effective against transactions.Please don't mistake this point as an argument that \"blocking monkey jpegs is CeNSoRShIP!\". \u00a0While I wouldn't *completely* dismiss the merits of that argument, it's weak at best and entirely not my point: \u00a0 My point is that any tool that DOES block monkey jpegs would be no less effectual for some state mandated blacklist. \u00a0The fact that filtering has limited effectiveness is *good news*, and we would be very foolish to muddy the waters by playing an extended game of wack-a-mole that gives anyone any ideas, that writes out a roadmap for actually censoring transactions to whatever extent they can be, \u00a0or which sticks bitcoin developers or miners in a position of being punished for failing to implement or make effective some form of censorship that various powerful entities demand. \u00a0Even though such actual censorship would ultimately be ineffectual that doesn't mean it couldn't cause tremendous harm.And all have a significant incentive to do so that can't be escaped, in that the resources available are limited and that there is enough traffic to create meaningful fees. \u00a0This is something that was far less that case at the time this non-standardness policy was initially set, in fact the minimum feerate has increased by a factor of 171 in real terms since then. \u00a0Blocks at the time contained only an average of 16% of their limit and so there was no market produced level of fees-- absent non-consensus rules it would have cost literally nothing to stuff in lots of trash. \u00a0Today blocks are consistently full capacity.When the limit was established Bitcoin wouldn't even have block file pruning for another year, so you couldn't even participate without keeping every piece of junk shoved in the chain on your drive.\u00a0 Today there are options designed and more or less implemented (though not included in Bitcoin Core) that let people bring up a node without ever downloading historical prunable data at all.\u00a0 So functional capacity limits moderate the data storage (ab)use and ultimately the answer may be to just not care about it at all because you're not storing it and you don't have to download the past stuff to bring up a node.\u00a0 Obviously not validating every bit of history has its own cost (though there are ZKP proposals that might even eliminate those but they're still very theoretical), it is an *actual* solution to much of the data embedding harms and it's one that doesn't require building ineffectual censorware or get mooted by the embedders disguising their data.",

Your post went through numerous points, but none of them appear to make the case that eliminating that particular limit would cause any harm. \u00a0 To make sure that I'm not missing any, allow me to make another pass on just that point:- You suggest monkey jpegs won't shift to using OP_RETURN. \u00a0I agree. \u00a0This is not a reason that removing the op_return limit would be harmful.- Core devs something with some person something another? \u00a0 Of no relevance to the op_return limit and not something I know anything about.- You claim I claim that there is an anticipation of not yet happened more harmful ways. \u00a0 If so this is still not a reason removing the limit would be harmful. \u00a0But as a point of order, users stuffing data in 'fake address' outputs is a current thing, not an anticipated thing.- You claim Pieter ridiculed users, I think you're mistaken (unless you're complaining that he insulted inscriptions users) but it's also of no relevant to the op_return limit.- You claim (and I don't dispute though I haven't checked) that there are not that many non-standard op_return transactions being mined. \u00a0This is no a reason that removing the limit would be harmful, it is a confirmation of my point that they are being mined.- You point out that inscriptions bloated the chainstate. \u00a0This is not a reason that removing the op_return limit would be harmful (they don't use op_return, but if they did it would reduce chainstate bloat, though I don't expect them to).- \"when Core devs themselves said things like use blocksonly or a bad and shaky claim that we will have utreexo or assumeutreexo in the future\" \u00a0I have no idea what you're talking about, but again, it does not provide a reason that removing the op_return limit is harmful.- You've vaguely referred to counter arguments to my point that mismatching relay with mining hurts propagation, which might be somewhat relevant but you haven't specified where so I don't know what you're talking about. \u00a0But that said even if my argument on why failing to disable the limit causes harm was in error, this is still not a reason that it would be harmful to disable the limit.- You attempt to dismiss my credibility on technology I invented *and* deployed, by dismissing me as a theoretician and suggesting that unspecified \"practical\" people know better. \u00a0Yet again, not a reason it would be harmful to disable the limit.- You suggest communications should improve, complain about moderation not having a good appearance. OK but, at this point you can sing it with me, still no reason removing the limit is harmful.Have I understood correctly?",

That's (part of) what it's there for, and it support's bitcoin's core value of minimizing subjective human influence on the ways that third parties can interact. \u00a0It's always the case that you could make something better by injecting a good human judgement call, \u00a0but in doing that you take the risk of a bad human judgement call. \u00a0Better to minimize human judgement, and set crisp content neutral boundaries at the points where some decisions must be made.",

        "body": "Because some of us have been here since the start or have studied it enough to know how Bitcoin has been presented and understood. \u00a0Perhaps not you, and that's fine-- but other people know things you don't.  \u00a0Particularly in this context as both d5000 and I are speaking in favor of *not limiting* and so the reason that we've both pointed out that the purpose of Bitcoin is not as some file storage is to make it clear that supporting removing a limit doesn't mean we think that's a good use of Bitcoin. We're all aware that there are people who argue otherwise, but we're not actually having a debate on that subject in this context.The position I'm taking is similar to defending the rights of bigots to have a parade. \u00a0You don't have to be a bigot to support free speech for everyone. \u00a0You don't have to support bigotry to acknowledge that stopping a parade won't stop bigotry and may even promote it. \u00a0But whenever I tell someone that I support the right to have a bigotry parade I'm gonna make it clear that I think bigotry is bad. \u00a0I think dumping irrelevant external data into bitcoin has a lot of potential for harm and I oppose it, and for anyone who cares Satoshi did too. It's been widely but not universally opposed pretty much Bitcoin's entire existence. \u00a0If it were realistically possible to block it probably would have been, but it's not so it isn't.This fact has even inspired the creation of altcoins specifically centered on this 'application'. \u00a0Of course they crash and burn because the applications are inevitably dumb, pointless, or just unrealistic (turns out a public blockchain is about the least efficient way to store data ever invented).I mean that's kind of a useless comment, no offense intended. If that's your position why post? It's an empty position. \u00a0Anything could be done differently, and how can you know that there is a better solution unless you know of one?Stop with the allowed thing. \u00a0That is serf thinking. \u00a0No one is allowing you or not allowing you to do anything. \u00a0There is the fable of an elephant held with a tiny rope. When the elephant was small it couldn't break the rope and then it was conditioned for its whole life to believe the rope held it. \u00a0The option in the software is a rope, you think that the choices that it offers you are your constraints.

But if that wasn't enough opreturn wouldn't be what they'd use, they'd shove stuff in the witnesses.\u00a0But people embedding data in Bitcoin transactions inherently don't care much about how efficient it is. \u00a0If you just want to store data on the internet the cost to store it *forever* in Amazon S3, which is a pretty expensive option, is on the order of a hundred thousand times less expensive than the minimum bitcoin feerates. \u00a0All of the price sensitive 'data storage' has already been eliminated.",

        "body": "Simpler is better ... so removing complexity from the bitcoin codebase is a huge mistake? \u00a0?(added hyperlink)Hi Og, I made an agreement with another forum poster that you would give me all your assets. \u00a0Of course, your participation was expressly and explicitly excluded from our negotiation, but none the less you have obligations and aren't living up to them right now. Pay up! \u00a0I'll let you keep a cardboard box to sleep in, and if you're nice a swamp cooler.
