Summary of "The Examiner" Monero Tracing Tool
Super Testnet introduces "The Examiner" (also called "Snooper Testnet"), a new tool for examining the Monero blockchain to trace transactions back to their origin and destination.
Core Functionality & Information Displayed:
For any selected Monero transaction from a block, The Examiner displays:
Transaction identifier.
All possible senders (ring members) for each input. Monero transactions broadcast this list with a proof that the real sender is within the group.
The people who received money (recipients).
Information about the fee and amount, including a lower bound approximation for outputs (and consequently inputs, which must be greater).
Timing information related to the block.
Tracing Mechanisms & Heuristics:
Manual Decoy Elimination:
Users can manually mark possible senders as decoys. For example, if a user recognizes their own pub key (verifiable with their view key) and knows they didn't make the transaction, they can eliminate themselves.
Investigators can eliminate an output belonging to a known entity (e.g., a seized darknet market whose Monero address and outputs are known) if that entity couldn't have made the transaction.
Automated Decoy Elimination (Heuristics):
Recency Bias: Monero wallets tend to select recent outputs as decoys. The tool can automatically flag possible senders whose inputs are significantly older than other inputs in the ring, which are from recent blocks (e.g., an input from a million blocks ago while others are from within 10,000 blocks, or 200,000 in the demo equals true mode). This "sticks out like a sore thumb" and suggests the old input is the true spend. The speaker notes the specific transaction example shown does not actually exhibit recency bias without demo mode adjustments.
Multi-Input Transaction Timing Analysis: In multi-input transactions, Monero's input selection mechanism uses a decaying gamma function. It's statistically rare for a wallet to select two old UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) that were created in blocks very close to each other (e.g., within five blocks) unless the sender specifically received those funds close together and had to merge them. The tool can use this timing analysis to identify likely true inputs. (The speaker notes demo mode parameters were adjusted for this example).
Recipient Analysis & Data Handling:
Recipients are listed in plain text on Monero, allowing users to label them.
The tool tracks other transactions recipients appear in. Since the Blockchair's API (used to fetch Monero blockchain data) doesn't provide this cross-referencing for outputs like some Bitcoin's blockchain explorers do, Blockchair's (referring to the API/service) does not offer this directly. The Examiner saves a record of every transaction an output has been seen in.
Future Heuristics Planned:
Identifying transactions from exchanges or bots by looking for characteristics like consolidating inputs or sending to a large group of outputs in one transaction (a behavior uncommon for regular users). This could help in identifying change addresses.
Motivation & Availability:
The tool was inspired by a proprietary visual Monero tracing tool from CypherTrace (a blockchain analysis company), a screenshot of which was shown (posted on Reddit). This visualizer showed inputs to a transaction and how decoys were eliminated to narrow down the true spend.
Super Testnet aimed to create a free and open source alternative to allow community contributions and improvements, as CypherTrace doesn't reveal its source code.
The Examiner will be available on Super Testnet's GitHub.
The tool allows users to build up a record and a "tree of statistical analysis" to deduce the probable sender in Monero transactions by systematically eliminating decoys based on various heuristics and known information. The goal is to provide free and open source Monero tracing tools and visualizers.
